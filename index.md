## Introduction

* Unclear whether the second plague pandemic was driven by rat fleas or human ectoparasites [1, 2]
* Mathematical models can help identify the underlying biological mechanisms
* Dean et al.â€™s [3] conclusion that these epidemics were driven by human ectoparasites relies on strong assumptions [4]

## Methods

* Particle MCMC [5] + biologically informed priors on all model parameters
* Use ternary plots to summarize results
* Incorporate information from Third Pandemic plague epidemics with known transmission modes
* Validate with simulation studies

## Combined transmission model
